# Student Recruitment

I’m actively recruiting students excited about working at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), End-User Software Engineering, Machine Learning (ML), and Natural Language Processing (NLP) to join me in addressing the societal challenges in the future of work through a bottom-up human-AI collaborative approach that helps individual workers automate and augment their tasks with AI systems.

You may find more about my research in my [research statement](fake/path).

## Prospective Ph.D Students

I have several Ph.D. positions in Computer Science at the University of Notre Dame starting Spring 2022 or Fall 2022. Strong candidates should have be self-motivated, passionate about research, interested in the human aspects of AI (in addition to the technical aspects), and have strong programming skills. Ph.D. students at Notre Dame are typically fully funded with full tuition, health insurance, travel funding opportunities, and a generous stipend. You may learn more about the program here.

Candidates with ANY of the following qualifications would be particularly encouraged: (1) prior experience in designing, implementing, and studying interactive systems; (2) knowledge in machine learning and natural language processing; (3) skills in developing AR/VR applications; (3) prior experience in software engineering (SE) or programming language (PL) research; (4) interdisciplinary research backgrounds (design, psychology, social science etc.)

Interested individuals may contact me with the following information: (1) your CV; (2) a copy of your transcripts; (3) a brief description of your background and research interests; and (4) representative publications or writing samples (course papers are okay) if available. The subject of the email should start with “[PROSPECTIVE-PHD]”. I will reach out if your background seems like a potential good fit.

## Undergraduate Students

I am excited to work with undergraduate students who are interested in my research. Many undergraduate researchers who worked with me became co-authors on my papers, and a lot of them are now at top graduate schools (e.g., Stanford, University of Washington, CMU, Cambridge) and industry companies (e.g., Google, Facebook, Microsoft). Projects are often available for students with backgrounds or interests in software development, machine learning, natural language processing, data science, UX research, OR UX design.

Interested individuals may contact me with the following information: (1) your CV; (2) a copy of your transcripts; (3) a brief description of your background and research interests. The subject of the email should start with “[PROSPECTIVE-NDUG]”. We can then find a time to meet to discuss potential projects.

## Visiting Students and Scholars

I might be able to host visiting students (undergraduate or graduate) and scholars at times depending on research interests, project needs, and funding situations.

Interested individuals may contact me with the following information: (1) your CV; (2) a copy of your transcripts (if student); (3) a brief description of your background and research interests; and (4) representative publications or writing samples (course papers are okay) if available. The subject of the email should start with “[PROSPECTIVE-VISITOR]”. I will reach out if your background seems like a potential good fit.

## About University of Queensland

<img src="{{ base_path }}/images/uq_campus.png" alt="uq-campus" width="100%"/>

The University of Queensland (UQ, or Queensland University) is a public research university located primarily in Brisbane, the capital city of the Australian state of Queensland. Founded in 1909 by the Queensland parliament, UQ is one of the six sandstone universities, an informal designation of the oldest university in each state. The University of Queensland was ranked second nationally by the Australian Research Council in the latest research assessment and equal second in Australia based on the average of four major global university league tables. The University of Queensland is a founding member of edX, Australia's research-intensive Group of Eight and the global Universitas 21 network.

The main St Lucia campus occupies much of the riverside inner suburb of St Lucia, southwest of the Brisbane central business district. Other UQ campuses and facilities are located throughout Queensland, the largest of which are the Gatton campus and the Mayne Medical School. UQ's overseas establishments include UQ North America office in Washington D.C., and the UQ-Ochsner Clinical School in Louisiana, United States.

The university offers associate, bachelor, master, doctoral, and higher doctorate degrees through a college, a graduate school, and six faculties. UQ incorporates over one hundred research institutes and centres offering research programs, such as the Institute for Molecular Bioscience, Boeing Research and Technology Australia Centre, the Australian Institute for Bioengineering and Nanotechnology, and the UQ Dow Centre for Sustainable Engineering Innovation. Recent notable research of the university include pioneering the invention of the HPV vaccine that prevents cervical cancer, developing a COVID-19 vaccine that was in human trials, and the development of high-performance superconducting MRI magnets for portable scanning of human limbs.

UQ counts two Nobel laureates (Peter C. Doherty and John Harsanyi), over a hundred Olympians winning numerous gold medals, and 117 Rhodes Scholars among its alumni and former staff. UQ's alumni also include UCSF Chancellor Sam Hawgood, the first female Governor-General of Australia Dame Quentin Bryce, President of King's College London Ed Byrne, member of United Kingdom's Prime Minister Council for Science and Technology Max Lu, Oscar and Emmy awards winner Geoffrey Rush, triple Grammy Award winner Tim Munro, the former CEO and Chairman of Dow Chemical, and current Director of DowDuPont Andrew N. Liveris.
