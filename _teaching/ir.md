description: "This course discusses the theory, design, and implementation of Information Retrieval (IR) techniques in text-based information systems. The theoretical component of the course focuses on IR methods for the processing, indexing, querying, ranking, organisation, and classification of textual documents, including Web documents. A variety of current research topics are also covered, including professional search and recommendation systems. The practical component of the course addresses the design and implementation of high-capacity text retrieval and filtering systems such as web search engines. I TA'd this course with <a href='http://ielab.io/people/guido-zuccon' target='_blank'>A/Prof. Guido Zuccon</a> in Spring 2020 and Spring 2021. My responsibilities included holding weekly tutorials and office hours, designing and grading assignments, projects, and exams, as well as a guest lecture about using BERT model for reranking."
